=== SOCKET
socket() creates an endpoint of communication and returns file descriptor 
that refers to endpoint.

The domain argument specifies a communication domain; this selects the protocol family which will be  used  for  communication.

AF_INET --- IpV4

SOCK_STREAM  Provides  sequenced,  reliable,  two-way,  connection-based byte streams.  An out-of-band data transmission
             mechanism may be supported.

=== sockaddr_in
/* Structure describing an Internet socket address.  */
struct sockaddr_in

=== BIND

bind() binds a name to a socket.

When  a  socket  is  created  with socket(2), it exists in a name space (address family) but has no address assigned to it.
bind() assigns the address specified by addr to the socket referred to by the file descriptor  sockfd.   addrlen  specifies
the size, in bytes, of the address structure pointed to by addr.  Traditionally, this operation is called “assigning a name
to a socket”.

=== LISTEN
listen()  marks  the socket referred to by sockfd as a passive socket, that is, as a socket that will be used to accept in‐
coming connection requests using accept(2).


=== ACCEPT
The  accept()  system call is used with connection-based socket types (SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_SEQPACKET).  It extracts the first
connection request on the queue of pending connections for the listening socket, sockfd, creates a  new  connected  socket,
and  returns  a new file descriptor referring to that socket.  The newly created socket is not in the listening state.  The
original socket sockfd is unaffected by this call.
