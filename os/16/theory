tcgetattr()  gets  the parameters associated with the object referred by fd and stores them in the termios structure refer‐
enced by termios_p.  This function may be invoked from a background process; however, the terminal attributes may be subse‐
quently changed by a foreground process.

tcsetattr()  sets the parameters associated with the terminal (unless support is required from the underlying hardware that
is not available) from the termios structure referred to by termios_p.  optional_actions specifies when  the  changes  take
effect:
       TCSANOW
              the change occurs immediately.

       TCSADRAIN
              the change occurs after all output written to fd has been transmitted.  This option should be used when changing pa‐
              rameters that affect output.

       TCSAFLUSH
              the change occurs after all output written to the object referred by fd has been transmitted, and all input that has
              been received but not read will be discarded before the change is made.
