The popen()  function  opens a process by creating a pipe, forking, and invoking the shell.  Since a pipe is by definition
    unidirectional, the type argument may specify only reading or writing, not both; the resulting  stream  is  correspondingly
    read-only or write-only.

The pclose() function waits for the associated process to terminate and returns the exit status of the command as returned
    by wait4(2).


The dup() system call creates a copy of the file descriptor oldfd, using the lowest-numbered unused file descriptor for the
new descriptor.
